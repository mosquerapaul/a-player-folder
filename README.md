# a-player-folder
Audio player to play all files located in the /audio folder

## Update 
I'm working in an Angular version of the project, so there are not updates spected.
Angular version: https://github.com/mosquerapaul/audio-player

# Description
This is a project similar to a gallery for audio files. Just put your audio files into a folder and it will manage to add all of them to the player.

## Live test 
https://audio-player-node-jquery.herokuapp.com/
Heroku will prevent to upload files, so you need to install the app into a local server to check this functionality.

# Installation
At the moment the project is created as an app, so you can check and test:
1- Download the project
2- Run npm install
3- Run the router app: node router.js
4- Launch the url: http://localhost:3000/

# Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.
