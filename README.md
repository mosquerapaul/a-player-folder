# a-player-folder
Audio player to play all files located in the music folder

# Description
This is a project similar to a gallery for audio files. Just put your audio files into a folder and it will manage to add all of them to the player.

# Installation
Working on

# Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.
